# CF---World-Happiness-Report-2015-2019-
An analysis of the UN World Happiness Reports from 2015-2019

# Data Source
The World Happiness Report surveys the state of global happiness by ranking participating countries by their happiness levels. Respondents to the World Gallup Poll were asked to rank their current lives on a scale of zero to ten, with ten representing the best possible life. Six factors – GDP per capita, family/social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption and generosity – are also estimated as to the impact they may have on the life evaluations in each country when compared to the fictional country of Dystopia. Dystopia serves as a benchmark with values equal to the lowest national averages for all six factors. 

This analysis explored which factors are most strongly correlated with a high happiness score so that governments will be able to prioritize those factors to increase the wellbeing of their citizens.

This is an external data source with data being manually collected annually via survey for Gallup World Poll. As a well-respected and global source, this data can be considered trustworthy.
